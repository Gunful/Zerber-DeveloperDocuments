#### Zerber Documents

## I just see nothing but letters and symbols on my screen
### Click on the document icon (rendered blob) instead of the <> (source blob) mode

## Can I use Markdown/README.md for my projects?
### Yes! Markdown/README.md is free to use and only requires a bit of skill. [Cheat sheet/style list](https://markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/)
### You also can copy the files of the repository because we don't have copyright and you can use them but DO NOT ACT LIKE ZERBER.
